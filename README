# About

The course in the Spring semester of 2023. 

XV6 is a simple Unix-like teaching operating system that serves as a reference to better understand the concepts of operating systems.

This repository is for  first phase of the xv6 Operating System course project at Amirkabir University of Technology in Fall 2022

## Overview

In this phase, we have extended the xv6 operating system by adding new system calls to enhance its functionality.



## Added System Calls

- `getTicks`: A system call that returns the number of timer ticks since the operating system started.
- `getProcInfo`: This system call provides the PID and creation time of all processes in the RUNNING state.

The functionality of these parts can be tested using `getTicksTest` and `getProcInfoTest` commands.
